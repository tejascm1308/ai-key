#### Revenue Model Details

**Free Tier Strategy:**

- **Purpose:** Acquisition, viral growth, data to train LTM
- **Limitation:** 2 hours/day AI _active_ time (when suggestions are used)
- **Why this works:**
  - Heavy users (2+ hrs/day typing) hit limit daily
  - Light users (30 min/day) never upgrade → still promote via word-of-mouth
  - Limit is "soft interrupt" (mid-email) → high conversion moment

**Pro Tier Strategy:**

- **Purpose:** Primary revenue, unlock full value
- **Price Point:** $8/month = 1 coffee/week for 30 min/day saved
- **Annual Plan:** $80/year (17% discount) → upfront revenue, lower churn
- **Value Equation:** $8 ÷ 30 days = $0.27/day for 45 min saved = **$0.006/minute saved**

**Teams Tier (Future):**

- B2B expansion post-PMF
- Avg deal size: $200/month (15-20 users)
- Medical/legal requiring HIPAA compliance

### Revenue Projections (12 Months)

| ----- | ---------- | --------- | --------------- | -------------- |
| 1     | 500        | 25        | $200            | $2.4K          |
| 3     | 3,000      | 180       | $1.4K           | $17K           |
| 6     | 12,000     | 720       | $5.8K           | $69K           |
| 9     | 30,000     | 2,100     | $16.8K          | $202K          |
| 12    | 50,000     | 3,500     | $28K            | $336K          |

**Year 1 Target:** $200K ARR (conservative at 7% conversion)

**Year 2 Target:** $1.2M ARR (150K free, 12K Pro)

### Unit Economics

```
CUSTOMER ACQUISITION:
──────────────────────
CAC (Blended):           $3
  - Organic (70%):       $0 (Chrome Store, viral)
  - Paid (30%):          $10 (ads, influencers)

CUSTOMER LIFETIME VALUE:
────────────────────────
Pro Monthly:             $8
Avg Retention:           12 months (50% churn/year)
Gross Revenue/User:      $96
Processing Fees (3%):    -$3
COGS (local AI):         ~$0
Support Cost:            -$5/year
──────────────────────
LTV per Pro User:        $88

LTV:CAC Ratio:           29:1 ✅ (target >3:1)
Payback Period:          0.4 months ✅
Gross Margin:            92% ✅
```

**Why This Works:**

- **Zero COGS:** RunAnywhere SDK runs locally (no GPU costs)
- **Infinite Scalability:** 1M users costs same as 1K users (~$10K hosting/month)
- **High Margin:** SaaS benchmark = 70-80%, we achieve 92%

## 4. Free → Pro Conversion Engine

### The Gating Mechanism

**2-Hour Daily AI Active Time Limit:**

```
User types → AI suggests → Counts toward daily 2hr quota
         ↓
   Hits limit mid-task → "Upgrade for 24/7?" modal
         ↓
   Pro unlocks: Never interrupted + voice + premium models
```

**What Counts as "Active Time":**

- ✅ When suggestions are shown and accepted/dismissed
- ✅ When voice input is used
- ❌ Regular typing without AI engagement
- ❌ Time app is idle

**Example User Journey:**

```
9:00 AM  - Starts email in Gmail → AI suggests (10 min active)
9:45 AM  - Slack messages → AI suggests (15 min active)
11:00 AM - Writing doc in Word → AI suggests (30 min active)
2:00 PM  - Code in VS Code → AI suggests (40 min active)
4:30 PM  - More emails → AI suggests (25 min active)

Total Active: 2 hours
         ↓
5:15 PM  - Tries to use AI → "Daily limit reached. Upgrade to Pro for $0.27/day"
```

Revenue per Pro User: $8
Variable Cost/User: $0.35
Net Revenue/User: $7.65

Break-Even: 500 ÷ 7.65 = 66 Pro users
```

**We break even at 66 Pro users (~1,300 free users at 5% CVR).**

## 7. Key Metrics & Success Criteria

### North Star Metric

**Time Saved per User per Day:**  
Target = 30+ minutes/day

Calculation:

```
Time Saved = (Suggestions Accepted × Avg Length) ÷ User Typing Speed
```

Example:

- 50 suggestions accepted/day
- Avg suggestion: 15 characters
- User typing speed: 60 WPM (5 chars/sec)
- Time saved: (50 × 15) ÷ 5 chars/sec = 150 seconds = **2.5 min/suggestion cycle**
- Daily: ~30-45 minutes

### Product Metrics (Weekly Tracking)

| Metric                         | Target          | Why It Matters                      |

|                          | REBASE     | Grammarly          | Copilot      | ChatGPT         |
| ------------------------ | ---------- | ------------------ | ------------ | --------------- |
| **Universal (All Apps)** | ✅         | ❌ Web only        | ❌ IDE only  | ❌ Copy-paste   |

### Sustainable Competitive Moats

**1. Data Moat (LTM Personalization):**

- The longer you use REBASE, the better it gets
- Competitors can't replicate your 6-month learned patterns
- Switching cost increases over time

**2. Technology Moat (RunAnywhere SDK):**

- 100% local execution = 90%+ margins (competitors pay $0.10-0.50 per user for cloud LLMs)
- Impossible to match on price without sacrificing quality
- Privacy guarantee (architectural, not policy)

**3. Integration Moat (Universal Keyboard):**

- OS-level integration harder to replicate than web extension
- Desktop + mobile = highest friction for competitors
- Network effects: "Works in ALL my apps"

**4. Speed Moat:**

- On-device inference = 50-150ms (vs cloud 200-500ms)
- Adaptive debouncing feels more natural
- Users can feel the difference
